<h2>Project Summary</h2>
<h4>To create a system that can extract JSON files, translate the encrypted transactions, and upload that information into a database that will act as a distributed ledger. 
</h4>
<h3>A.	What Is a Blockchain?</h3>
<p>•	 A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger shared among a network of computers (nodes).</p>
<p>•	While it’s most famous for its role in cryptocurrency systems, it’s not limited to just that.</p>
<p>•	Blockchains can be used to make data in any industry immutable, meaning it cannot be altered.</p>
<p>•	Unlike traditional databases, where trust often relies on third parties, blockchains operate without a central authority.</p>
<p>•	Decentralized blockchains are particularly interesting because no single person or group controls them—instead, all users collectively retain control.</p>
<h3>B.	How Does a Blockchain Work?</h3>
<p>•	Imagine a spreadsheet or database where information is entered and stored.</p>
<p>•	In a blockchain, data is structured differently and accessed via a series of blocks linked together using cryptography.</p>
<p>•	Here’s how it works:</p>
<p>•	Transaction Information: The blockchain collects transaction data and enters it into a block.</p>
<p>•	Creation: A block is created after a predetermined amount of time.</p>         
<p>•	Chained Blocks: This hash becomes part of the next block, creating a chain of blocks.</p>
<p>•	Immutable: Once data is recorded, it’s irreversible. For example, in Bitcoin, transactions are permanently viewable by anyone.</p>
